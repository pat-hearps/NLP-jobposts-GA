The Opportunity  Two years ago we took the plunge to invest in Analytics as a standalone Practice, to reflect the growing scale and importance of this function within our clients’ organisations. Today we have a really
          capable team and our strong industry networks with leading employers and track record of delivery have made us the market leader for roles across Business Intelligence and Data Science, as well as specialist HR, Risk and Customer Analytics in
          both Auckland and Wellington.  You’ll join a hugely experienced leadership team here in Auckland, reporting directly to the General Manager. You’ll be responsible for continuing the momentum of this national practice, being hands on
          with relationship development and getting involved with some delivery to clients too. You’ll create a business plan to support building on the existing headcount of three.  This an ideal leadership challenge for someone looking to write
          their own success story without starting from scratch.  You  You value relationships, thrive off seeing other’s success and appreciate the power of collaboration. Your leadership experience has also taught you
          that creating a high performance culture and bringing the best out of others comes from far more than cranking the KPI wheel - that approach won’t work here.  We’d prefer you have networks within the local technology or analytics community
          but we’re more interested in a great recruiter who wants to build on their leadership experience and create a high performing team.  What you’ll get  You’ll be able to progress your own career with leadership
          training and transparent career progression criteria, and most importantly you’ll work with some top shelf people. Although the extra annual leave, flexibility, extensive resources and a brand that opens doors doesn’t hurt!  Hear what

Based south of the Perth CBD, our client is a national not-for-profit community organisation who works across urban and remote areas of Australia. A well-established, successful and respected organisation, their focus is helping youth and disadvantaged
          people to improve their chances at having the kind of lives that all people deserve. 
This is a kind and generous group of people, and the office environment reflects this; they are compassionate and friendly like a family, but at the same time, everyone is self-motivated and dedicated to achieving objectives. The offices are modern
          and refurbished, surrounded by parklands and gardens, close to a range of great amenities, and easily accessible by public transport. 
WHAT’S INVOLVED? 
They are currently undergoing the implementation of a new data management system, and your role will be to take the reigns after implementation. Reporting directly to the Chief Operations Officer, this role is primarily about managing and reporting
          data and information and maintain contract compliance. There will be a research component  to this job, and some administrative support for the COO such as compiling board papers. 
You can expect to be relied upon by the executive team; attending and minuting executive meetings, and preparing presentations and reports for a range of stakeholders (including Federal government agencies), based on the data that you collate
          and extrapolate. 
This is such a critical role in the organisation; without up-to-date, quality data reporting the organisation cannot grow and progress. In a not-for-profit environment, there is always the need to justify your funding and prove your worth – this
          role will be the key to ensuring they can keep doing the amazing work they are doing to help the community and make sure they focus on effective programs which have the most impact. A few of the things you will be involved in include:

Maintaining the (new) database system (and training new users as needed)
Research and source data from a range of sources, internal and external and analyse data
Consolidate data into reports for the executive team
Prepare a range of reports on a regular basis for internal and external use, including significant government agencies
Build relationships and liaise with government stakeholders
Co-ordinate regional management meetings, including logistics and agendas, and post-meeting duties including distributing minutes and following up on action items

DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES? 
This is a challenging role for someone who in that place in their career where they have the confidence and experience to make informed decisions. You will need to bee career-focused and committed to the cause. 
We want someone who genuinely loves working with data and finding meaning in data, and is able to communicate findings to a wide range of people in an interesting and engaging way. 
We need someone who is happy doing high-level reporting but just as comfortable doing basic database administration, or creating PowerPoint presentations; you need a service-mentality; the kind of person is comfortable saying “how can I help you?”
          In short; you must be an engaged, valuable, and active part of the team. 
You will also need these skills, attributes, qualifications and experience:

Advanced MS Word, PowerPoint and Excel skills (you should be an Excel superstar, in fact)
Demonstrated effective business case and report-writing skills, particularly liaising with government agencies
Experience in a compliance-focused environment
Ideally a tertiary qualification which has led to statistical analysis and research capabilities
Experience sourcing, analysing, managing and presenting relevant and useful data
Experience managing contractual compliance requirements
Experience providing support at an executive level
Intelligence that you can apply to solve problems
Good organisational skills, with outstanding attention to detail
The ability to think strategically and see the big picture – staying attentive to goals
Down-to-earth, easy-going, but able to focus and go the extra mile to get things done
Passionate about the work and loyal
Independent; able to use your initiative and self-motivated
Truly exceptional communication skills

The Solution Designer is responsible for understanding problems and coordinating solutions for Sage Products and Services.  The role requires key business analysis skills, including stakeholder management, requirements engineering and problem
          solving as well as a sufficient level of technical and domain knowledge to allow them to operate as a facilitating ‘hub’ for the whole project team.  The Solution Designer will create accurate and unambiguous artefacts, ensuring that all
          issues are raised and managed to completion.  They will establish and maintain strong links with all stakeholders in order to ensure both that stakeholder needs are properly understood and that stakeholders themselves properly understand
          the solution that is proposed and its implications.  The Solution Designer will have an eye for detail and be quality focussed; resulting in thorough and well-organized analysis across all projects they work on.  The Solution Designer
          must be able to both define careful, incremental improvements to existing solutions and to bring radical and challenging approaches to bear, constantly asking why things are as they are and whether new ideas may not be more effective. 
          In order to determine what kind of approach is the best in a specific situation the Solution Designer will always use the test of asking “How will this benefit the customer?” as their most important guide.
The Solution Designer will have experience of at least one domain or area of the business, though may not yet be considered a domain expert.  Where working with technical functions such as Development, QA, Support or LSM, the Solution Designer
          will be able to communicate at a technical level, understanding at a high level key technologies and patterns and – in particular – the opportunities and constraints they represent.  When appropriate – and where it is most efficient to
          do so - a solution designer may be directly involved in producing artefacts that could form part of a delivery – for example, defining a specific report by creating it or configuring custom metadata to implement specific business rules. 
          Prior to a formal QA process, the Solution Designer will also be responsible for validating that an implemented solution solves the original problem and does what was intended.
Responsibilities

Be part of a high-performing project team of 20 academics attacking the challenge of Moral AI
ANU, the place to be: #1 in Australia and in the World's Top 25
Live in one of the cities with the highest quality of life and one
            of the most enjoyable to visit

Position overview
The ANU is launching a major new project on Humanising Machine Intelligence, uniting computer scientists, philosophers, and social scientists in the pursuit of a more ethical future for AI and Machine Learning.
Machine intelligence is already used in innumerable applications that, while not explicitly morally-loaded, have clear and profound social implications, from facial recognition, to the distribution of online attention. It is also used to support
          decisions that have explicit moral dimensions, for example about how to allocate welfare resources, and whom to grant bail or parole. And the application of MI in fully autonomous decision-making systems (robotic and otherwise) is picking up
          pace. Self-driving vehicles, autonomous weapons systems, and companion robots are the first wave of such systems; many more are on the way. Many companies and governments are also heavily invested in developing more general, multipurpose forms
          of AI. All of these autonomous systems must be able to make morally-loaded decisions by themselves.
In each of these fields inadequate attention to ethics in the design of MI systems will predictably have negative social consequences, some of which could be catastrophic. The goal of the HMI project is to forestall those risks, and help to realise
          the tremendous social benefits promised by MI. The project has three components: (1) Discovery: formulate the design problem by identifying the social risks and opportunities of widespread reliance on MI. (2) Foundations: identify and answer
          the fundamental theoretical questions on which progress towards ethical MI depends. (3) Design: develop ethical algorithms and broader MI systems in partnership with industry and government.
The HMI project chief investigators are: Associate Professors Seth Lazar (Project Leader), Colin Klein and Katie Steele (Philosophy), Professors Marcus Hutter, Sylvie Thiébaux, Bob Williamson and Lexing Xie (Computer Science), Dr. Jenny Davis
          (Sociology), Associate Professor Idione Meneghel (Economics), and Professor Toni Erskine (Political Science).
We are looking for up to eight talented academics to help us humanise machine intelligence. Our primary criterion is demonstrated research excellence in a discipline area relevant to the project, and the clear potential to be research leaders
          in their disciplines and in the field of moral AI. An interdisciplinary background is not required, but successful applicants will be ready and equipped to engage with scholars from other disciplines and are expected to work actively with scholars
          from at least two of the project’s discipline areas.
Three of these new academics will be based in the Research School of Computer Science. Within this discipline, we strongly encourage researchers with a wide range of technical backgrounds, including but not limited to computational social choice
          and game theory, decision theory, information theory, logic and automated reasoning, general artificial intelligence, machine learning, optimisation, planning & scheduling, reasoning about constraints & preferences, and reinforcement
          learning. Though these positions will be housed in the Research School of Computer Science, we strongly encourage anyone who meets the selection criteria to apply, regardless of disciplinary background.
Successful applicants will help us design the next generation of more ethical MI systems, in part through publishing internationally influential research in the leading peer-reviewed venues (as suited to their discipline). We expect them to become
          leaders in academia, industry or government. As well as conducting research at the highest level, they will help build the HMI community at ANU and globally, through convening a regular seminar series and international workshops. They will also
          contribute, at a reduced intensity, to the education and outreach agendas of the School, in a manner appropriate to the level of appointment.
Positions are available at academic Level B (Research Fellow) and C (Senior Fellow) and are for an initial fixed-term duration of 3 years with the potential for extension to 5 years following a mid-term project review. For candidates who currently
          hold tenure-track or permanent appointments at universities, industry or government and in other exceptional circumstances, a tenure-track or continuing appointment may be considered.
Candidates who meet the selection criteria for this position may also submit applications to the other postdoctoral positions advertised here and here.
To enquire about these positions please contact Professors Sylvie Thiebaux (Sylvie.Thiebaux@anu.edu.au) or Lexing Xie (Lexing.Xie@anu.edu.au)
Closing Date: 15 February 2019

About us
Seeing Machines is a world leader in driver-machine interaction. We harness human factors science to create artificial intelligence (AI) technology that observes the driver's attention - reliably, unobtrusively, and in real time - and intervenes
          seamlessly when necessary.
Specialised computer vision algorithms underpin Seeing Machines' core camera-based driver monitoring technology. Algorithms allow us to precisely track eye gaze, head position and pupil size while our state-of-the-art AI technology analyses the
          data to quickly and accurately detect driver drowsiness, distraction and microsleep levels. We work with some of the world's leading brands to deliver this technology, helping keep drivers and operators engaged across commercial transport and
          logistics, automotive, aviation, rail and mining industries.
The WHY of our technology
• According to the World Health Organisation, over 1.3 million people die in road accidents, globally. 
• The American Automobile Association says that 1 in every 10 auto accidents in the US is fatigue related and that 25% of US car accidents are caused by distraction. 
• European Commission recommends that camera-based driver monitoring technology be mandated to enhance safety in cars, vans, trucks and buses from 2022. 
• Air traffic is set to double over 15 years and the world's aviation fleet is set to double in 20 years. This creates a huge demand for more pilots and air traffic management which increases pressure on training and safety frameworks for the
          aviation industry, globally. 
• Seeing Machines' Guardian technology for commercial fleets has been scientifically proven to reduce fatigue related driver events by more than 90%.

But when you meet the team here, that's exactly what you'll think of them. Just nice, good people. Just like Casey from the team, in this video.
With more than 29,000 customers, who collectively service over 10M Australians we're the absolute market leader in business messaging. That being said, we're undergoing some change; we're transitioning from a Technology business to a design-led
          Product businesses. As such our product offering is being redesigned and expanded, meaning we need to grow a World class Product team.
Our vision is for beautifully interactive products and we've got a whole bunch of super smart ideas, from AI to Big Data and beyond. Some of them will go on to become fully fledged products that our customers will leverage to succeed, some may
          not.
Our Product team has been in place for about 9 months or so now and we've made good headway in delivering on our vision.
To round out our team, we're hiring a Technical Business Analyst to work with our team to build an API suite that our customers will love, and that we'll consume ourselves for our own library of user interfaces.
Ideally, you'll come from an engineering background as you'll need some solid API/Technical understanding. We're expecting about 2/3 years minimum experience in an engineering role.  More importantly, you're going to need understanding
          or at least an opinion of what makes a great API Development experience and be able to articulate and build on that.  
Experience in a Business Analyst or Product owner role will be a big bonus and if you've worked in an Agile environment, well that's even better.  It's important that you know the difference between JSON and Jason, and that you're comfortable
          working in Trello, JIRA, Confluence and (of course), Slack.  If you're someone who normally has Postman open, and enjoy stuffing around with public APIs and webhook endpoints, we want to speak to you. We'll expect you to be able to test
          our API products and work closely with our Dev Rel team in getting to understand our client base and what they actually want.
You'll get to work in a cross-functional team, with an insanely smart engineering team, a ridiculously talented Product team and a business with a relentlessly entrepreneurial spirit.  That means you'll actually get smarter, which along with
          enjoying what you do and getting paid, makes this an actual dream gig.
We're kind of like a start-up within an established business, so you get to try stuff, fail fast, iterate and come up with ways to make our customers' lives easier and ensure they love doing business with us via thoughtfully design, beautifully
          simple products.
With ambitious goals and a Melbourne HQ, we offer some great perks for our team such as health and wellness initiatives, regular events, training and development programs, flexible work options, birthday leave, advanced technology stack, breakfast
          bar, end of trip facilities and more in the pipeline.
I hate inane lists and dot points of required technical skills on ads, but we run an AWS/Java/React tech stack on the whole, so your technical understanding of how that stack works is going to help you no end. As is your understanding of how API's
          work. I can't be any clearer than saying that this is a technical role as much as it is strategic. So at an interview, you'll need to be able to talk about API design and talk through the process and how you'd do that.
If you choose to apply and don't come from this background then it's going to be hard for us to progress your application. But if you do and you're able to work from either our Sydney or Melbourne locations and can start soon then hurrah!
          Because we're hiring right now.
